    h5table allows plugins to add additional functionality through the core
    adapters. You can change almost anything involving the way h5table works
    to the way h5table interacts with the page by modifying the core adapters.
    Most third-party plugins should provide decorators (used to wrap adapters)
    and custom adapters that you can use.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each adapter contains a set of methods which will must always be defined.
    Along with the global methods that all adapters must implement, these
    methods must be implemented.
  </p>

  <h2 id="adapters-all">
    All adapters
  </h2>

  <p>
    All adapters must implement a set of methods that h5table will use to
    display them and bind any internal events.
  </p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
// The basic HTML that should be rendered by h5table. A jQuery or DOM element
// should be returned, which will automatically be placed by h5table within the
// DOM.
//
// @returns A jQuery or DOM element that contains any elements that must be
//   rendered by h5table.
Adapter.render = function () {
  return $jq;
};

// Bind to any h5table or DOM events.
//
// @param container The h5table object that is bound to the jQuery element.  You
//   can listen to h5table events with `on` and trigger h5table events using the
//   `trigger` method.
// @param $container The jQuery DOM node that all default adapters will be
//   rendered within.
Adapter.bind = function (container, $container) { };

// Position the DOM element within the h5table DOM container, or in another
// place. This allows adapters to be located outside of the h5table DOM,
// such as at the end of the document or in a specific place within the h5table
// DOM node.
//
// Note: This method is not called on data adapters.
//
// @param $rendered The rendered DOM element that was returned from the call to
//   `render`. This may have been modified by h5table, but the root element
//   will always be the same.
// @param $defaultContainer The default container that h5table will typically
//   place the rendered DOM element within. For most adapters, this is the
//   h5table DOM element.
Adapter.position = function ($rendered, $defaultContainer) { };

// Destroy any events or DOM elements that have been created.
// This is called when `h5table("destroy")` is called on an element.
Adapter.destroy = function () { };
</pre>

  <h2 id="selectionAdapter">
    Container (selection)
  </h2>

  <p>
    The selection is what is shown to the user as a replacement of the
    standard <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> box. It controls the display of the
    selection option(s), as well anything else that needs to be embedded
    within the container, such as a search box.

// @param data An array of data objects that have been generated by the data
//   adapter. If no objects should be selected, an empty array will be passed.

SelectionAdapter.update = function (data) { };

  <h2 id="dataAdapter">
    Data set
  </h2>

  <p>
    The data set is what h5table uses to generate the possible results that
    can be selected, as well as the currently selected results.

  </dl>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">

// @param params.page The specific page that should be loaded. This is typically
//   provided when working with remote data sets, which rely on pagination to

  <h2 id="dropdownAdapter">
    Dropdown
  </h2>

  <p>
    The dropdown adapter defines the main container that the dropdown should
    be held in. <strong>It does not define any extra methods that can be used
    for decorators</strong>, but it is common for decorators to attach to the
    <code>render</code> and <code>position</code> methods to alter how the
    dropdown is altered and positioned.
  </p>

  <dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>Key</dt>

      <code>dropdownAdapter</code>

      <code title="h5table/dropdown">DropdownAdapter</code>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h2 id="resultsAdapter">
    Results
  </h2>

  <p>
    The results adapter controls the list of results that the user can select
    from. While the results adapter does not define any additional methods
    that must be implemented, it makes extensive use of the h5table event
    system for controlling the display of results and messages.
