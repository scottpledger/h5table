    Can I use h5table with my AMD or CommonJS loader?
  </h2>

  <p>
    Yes, h5table should work with most AMD or CommonJS loaders without any issues.
  </p>

  <h3>
    How do I tell h5table where to look for modules?
  </h3>

  <p>
    For most AMD and CommonJS setups, the location of the data files used by h5table will be automatically determined and handled without you needing to do anything.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are using h5table in a build environment where preexisting module names are changed during a build step, h5table may not be able to find optional dependencies or language files. You can manually set the prefixes to use for these files using the <code>amdBase</code> and <code>amdLanugageBase</code> options.
  </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
$.fn.h5table.defaults.set('amdBase', 'h5table/');
$.fn.h5table.defaults.set('amdLanguageBase', 'h5table/i18n/');
</pre>

  <h3>
    h5table is being placed before jQuery in my JavaScript file
  </h3>

  <p>
    Due to a bug in older versions of the r.js build tool, h5table was sometimes placed before jQuery in then compiled build file. Because of this, h5table will trigger an error because it won't be able to find or load jQuery.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can fix this issue by upgrading to a newer version of the r.js build tool.
